# Differential Gene Expression Analysis

This repository contains scripts and documentation for analyzing differential gene expression using publicly available datasets. The pipeline processes raw gene expression data, identifies differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and visualizes results to gain insights into biological processes.

## Overview

Differential gene expression analysis helps identify genes that are upregulated or downregulated under specific conditions, such as disease versus healthy states. This project demonstrates a complete workflow for analyzing gene expression data using tools like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn`.

### Key Features
- Preprocessing of raw count data.
- Identification of differentially expressed genes.
- Visualization of results (volcano plots, heatmaps, PCA).
- Integration with functional enrichment analysis.
